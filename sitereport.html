            <article>
                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Creating my portfolio website has been an insighful and rewarding experience.it gave me the opportunity to learn the basis of coding and explore.Although it came with its challenges, each step taught me something valuable and helped me grow.
                </p>

                <h2>Learning HTML and CSS</h2>
                <p>When I first started working with HTML and CSS,everything felt new and shightly overwelming.HTML introduced me to structuring a webpage, while CSS allowed me to style and enhance its apperance.Initially,even simple tasks,like creating a navigation bar or positioning elements,were challenging.However,as I praticed and explored,things started to make sense. Seeing the site come together,bit by bit,was incredibly satisfying and motivated me to keep learning.
                </p>

                <h2>Designing the Website</h2>
                <p>Designing the website was one of the most enjoyable aspects of this project.I wanted to create a clean and welcoming look,so i carefully chose a soft color palette.I used a beige background for a warm,neutral base and paired it with teal text to ensure readabality .Sky blue highlighted the headers and footers.For interactive elements like buttons, i chose coral and yellow-gold to make them stand out subtly.These colors worked well together to achieve the clam and pleasing design I envisioned.To complement this asthestic, I used a clean sans-serif font,ensuring the text was easy to read and modern.
                </p>

                <h2>Challenges Faced</h2>
                <p>However, the development process wasn't without its challenges.Making the website responsive was one of the biggest hurdles.Initially the layout worked fine on a desktop but didn't adjust well on mobile devices.I had to learn about media queries and apply them to ensure the design adapted smoothly across different screen sizes.It took time and experimentation,but overcoming this challenge was a significant achievement.
                </p>

                <h2>Debugging CSS Issues</h2>
                <p>Debugging CSS issues also proved to be a learning experience.Problems like misaligned elements inconistent spacing,or colors not displaying as intended were common.I uesd browser develpoer tools to inspect and fix these issues.Validating my code through HTML and CSS validators further helped me identify and reslove errors,making the final product cleaaner and more efficient.
                </p>

                <h2>Reflection on the Experience</h2>
                <p>Reflecting on this experience,i've realized how much I've learned.This project wasn't just about understanding how to write code;it also taught me to think creatively,solve problems systematically,and pay atttention to the small details that make a big difference.The Process has shown me the importance of patience and efforts.
                </p>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>Overall,creating my portfolio has been an incredible learning journey.This is just the begining of my journey in coding,and i'm excited to see how i acn further improve and expand my skills in the future.
